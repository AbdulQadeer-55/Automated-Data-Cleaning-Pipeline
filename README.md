## **Overview**
This repository contains a Python-based Jupyter Notebook for automating common data cleaning tasks such as handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, detecting and removing outliers, and scaling/normalizing features. The pipeline is designed to save you time and effort in data preprocessing, which is often the most labor-intensive part of any data science project.

Data cleaning is crucial for improving model performance and ensuring robust results. This pipeline can be seamlessly integrated into your existing workflows, whether you're working on machine learning models, exploratory data analysis, or data visualizations.

## **Key Features**
- üõ† **Missing Data Handling**: Automated imputation of missing values using various strategies (mean, median, etc.).
- üé® **Categorical Encoding**: Both label encoding and one-hot encoding for categorical features.
- üîç **Outlier Detection & Removal**: Uses Z-score to detect and eliminate outliers from the dataset.
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Feature Scaling**: Standardization of numeric features for more stable model performance.

## **Demo**
Here‚Äôs a quick overview of how the pipeline works with a sample dataset:

```python
# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

# Impute missing values
df = imputer.fit_transform(df)

# Encode categorical variables
df = onehot_encoder.fit_transform(df)

# Detect and remove outliers
df_cleaned = df[(z_scores < 3).all(axis=1)]

# Normalize the numeric features
df_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(df_cleaned)
```

## **Installation**

To use this pipeline locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/automated-data-cleaning-pipeline.git
   cd automated-data-cleaning-pipeline
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   You can install the required dependencies using pip and the provided `requirements.txt` file.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the notebook:**
   Open the Jupyter Notebook and execute the code cells to perform data cleaning.
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Automated_Data_Cleaning_Pipeline.ipynb
   ```

## **File Structure**
Here‚Äôs the structure of the project:

```bash

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cleaned_data.csv                        # Example output dataset
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt                        # List of dependencies

```

## **How It Works**

1. **Handling Missing Data**  
   The pipeline automatically fills missing data using the `SimpleImputer` from `scikit-learn`. You can specify different strategies (`mean`, `median`, etc.) depending on your dataset.

2. **Categorical Encoding**  
   The notebook demonstrates two types of encoding:
   - **Label Encoding**: Converts categorical variables to numeric values.
   - **One-Hot Encoding**: Converts categorical columns into multiple binary columns.

3. **Outlier Detection & Removal**  
   The Z-score method identifies outliers by calculating how far each data point is from the mean. If a Z-score is greater than a threshold (typically 3), it is flagged as an outlier and removed.

4. **Feature Scaling**  
   Normalization is done using `StandardScaler` to standardize the features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.

## **Usage Scenarios**
- **Model Preprocessing**: Quickly clean up datasets before feeding them into machine learning models.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Prepare datasets for analysis by handling missing values and outliers.
- **Automated Pipelines**: Integrate this script into automated pipelines to preprocess large-scale data.

## **Dependencies**
- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **SciPy**
- **scikit-learn**
  
All required libraries can be installed by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
